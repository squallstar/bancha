Bancha was originally developed by Nicholas Valbusa (Squallstar Studio).

Under the hood, the base framework was **CodeIgniter** by EllisLab, but we stronghly changed and improved its core to let it fly.

It is currently developed and maintained by the **Bancha team**, which consists in the lead developer Nicholas Valbusa, Alessandro Maroldi (Developer), Matteo Gildone (Developer), Michela Tannoia (Designer).

A hat tip goes to **Entigo** for inspiring us to create a new, powerful Content Management System based on PHP.
