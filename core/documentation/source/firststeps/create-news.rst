If you choose the **Blog** type installation, Bancha creates two content types for you: **Blog** and **Comments**. Remember that these two content types are linear so they haven't any kind of hierarchy each other.

Create a single post in the same way we created a page in the last chapter (:doc:`create-pages`), then save it.

Ok, we created a page, a post, what's now?
We need to set a page to list our posts, so users can see them.

Proceed to the **next chapter**: :doc:`listing-items`
