After installing Bancha (:doc:`/install/howtoinstall`), log into Bancha administration panel by appending **/admin** to the base url path.

On the left side, you will see the **Pages**, **Contents** and **Manage** menu.

Pages and Contents, are content types: they slightly differ by the scheme, because Pages are organized hierarchically and Content aren't.

The first Page content type installed by default is **Menu**. This content type will contains all the pages of your website.
Click on **Menu** on the list, and a record list of pages records will appear.

Discover how Bancha works, proceed to the **next chapter** of the tutorial: :doc:`stage-workflow`
