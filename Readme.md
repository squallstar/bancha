# MILK CMS

MILK is a Content Management System made with PHP5 and Code Igniter, a light and powerful PHP framework.
It is capable to manage medium and big projects/websites specially when they have many different types of contents.

MILK bases its power on some pillars that make it different from other CMS:
It allows you to handle any type of content: pages, news, photo galleries, products, etc ... through XML schemas.

 * It doesn't sacrifice the performance of a static site, because under the hood it uses many different caching systems.
 * It's modular, so it can be extended with different types of modules that you can develop yourself.
 * It's totally open-source (you can download the source from http://github.com/squallstar/milk).
 * It's easy to install and to maintain. It doesnt't need any complicated or advanced infrastructure: just PHP5 and a DB server (or a SQLite one).
  * It totally separates the application framework (MVC) from the website themes, so it's easy to use for web developers as well as web designers.
  * It use a wonderful ORM system to "play" with the database objects without the needs to write a single query.

The complete **MILK documentation** is available through the MILK administration panel, under **Manage > Documentation**.
